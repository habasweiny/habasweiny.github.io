    <h2>Me in 30 seconds</h2>
<p>I am an introverted, mildly curious guy who loves history, new ideas and the smell of coffee.
When I am not contributing actively to society, I am daydreaming. 
This may explain why  I don't watch movies anymore, my mind makes original oscar-winning films on demand.
I try to learn new things and write when I get some free time. Not always fun, but always rewarding.</p>

<p><a href="/now.html" target="_blank" >Here's</a> what I am doing now.</p>
      <p>Here are some essays I have written. Enjoy.
