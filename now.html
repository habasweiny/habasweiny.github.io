<p>I am currently interested in web development. I was
  drawn to this field because I wanted to build my own 
  website. I have learnt a bit of HTML and CSS. That 
  alone has helped me build and customize
this website. I am now learning Javascript.</p>
<p>Apart from programming, I am also focusing on improving 
  my writing. I will post some of them on this website.</p>
<p>Oh, and I recently finished medical school. I am
  currently in that weird gap between medical school
  and internship.</p>
<p>If you wish to contact me, you can reach me on <a href="https://twitter.com/hamzambo" target="_blank">twitter</a> or better yet send me an email at hamzambonet@gmail.com<p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
