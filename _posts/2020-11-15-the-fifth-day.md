One peculiarity of the Swahili
language is that both Wednesday and Thursday mean the same thing but in
different languages. Jumatano means the fifth day of the week in Kiswahili. Alhamisi-
from the Arabic word ‘Khamsa’- also translates to the fifth weekday. Let’s take
a tour exploring how the days of the week were named in various languages.



We’ll start with Arabic. It seems
that on a random day centuries ago a guy somewhere in the Middle East or Eastern
Africa got bored of having nameless days and started counting them. He named
the day he started counting yawmul ahad- meaning the first day. Yawul ahad is
Sunday in Arabic. The next day he continued counting. He called it Yawmul
Thanii or Al-ithnayn meaning the second day of the week. The third day he
called it Yawmul Thaalith or Al-thulathaa. Fourth day became Yawmul Raabi3 or
Al-Arbi3aa. For some reason, the counting stops on the fifth day, Yawmul
khaamis or Al-Khamis. 



The two remaining days are named
after social events. Al-Jumuah (Friday) means congregation (for prayers??) and
Al-Sabt (Saturday) is named after the Sabbath. The Somali language shamelessly
plagiarizes this Arabic entire vocabulary. Or it could be that the Arabic
language is the culprit; no one knows for sure. But the Swahili language,
despite the influence of Arabic, gets more creative. 



First, five of the names of the days
are in Kiswahili: Jumamosi to Jumatano. Only Alhamisi (originally Yawmul
Khaamis) and Ijumaa(originally Al-Jumuah) are in Arabic. Second, in the Swahili
language counting the days of the week starts on Saturday, not Sunday as in the
Arabic week. Jumamosi (Saturday) is the first day of the week. But then the change
in language from the Kiswahili ‘Jumatano’ to the Arabic ‘Alhamisi’ causes a
hilarious repetition.



Heading over to Europe, most languages there have days that were named after the seven visible ‘wandering’ celestial
bodies that could be seen with the naked eye from Earth. These were the sun,
moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. In Romance languages like
French and Spanish, the names remained unchanged.

However, the linguistically rebellious
Northern Europeans made a few blasphemous changes. Namely, they replaced some
of the names of the Roman or Greek gods, after whom the planets are named, with
their local gods.

So, there you have it. Have a
beautifully-named day.
