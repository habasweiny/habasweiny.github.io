There are a few questions one might ask about
this photo of me and my siblings. I'll answer
one : why was I dressed like I inherited clothes
from my dead grandfather? I always thought
mum was responsible. 
You see, mum was a
part-time tailor.One of the earliest memories I have is that of me
trying out a shirt mum had made for me in her
stall. When I started primary school, mum made
my school bag. But mum was meticulous in her
measurements. She made sure the clothes were
never oversized.

Turns out the clothes my brother and I wore in
the photo were presents by one of her closest
friends. Mum did not like them. We wore them to
Uhuru Park because that particular friend was
coming with us. I think mum secretly threw them
away after that because we never saw them
again. 

As for the salute, at that point in my life I wanted
to join the military when I grew up. Specifically, I
wanted to be a driver in the army. I loved
travelling and I thought soldiers looked cool with
their guns, camouflage and shit.
